# Web-app-for-hotels-and-restaurants or modern name FICHA

  
Our project directed to service sector. From small bars and hostels to restaurants with Michelin stars and hotels with world fame.  

Today's one of main problem is COVID-19. So we decided to make this project.  
  
  **Lets image:**  
  You came to restaurant and scaned QR-code. What you will see?  
  It will be only menu. It can be only pdf or even special site. So, to make your order you must call waiter.  
  ## BUT IF RESTAURANT WILL IMPLEMENT FICHA. 
  You can make your order with web-app. You mustn't speak with waiter. You can only choose what you want, and wait.
